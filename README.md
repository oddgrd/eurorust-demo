# Shuttle Demo 🚀

This is a demo service for Shuttle to showcase the following resources:

- [static-folder](https://docs.shuttle.rs/resources/shuttle-static-folder) 📁
- [secrets](https://docs.shuttle.rs/resources/secrets) 🔒
- [shared-db](https://docs.shuttle.rs/resources/shuttle-shared-db) 🗃️

## Running the Demo 🏃

The `main.rs` file contains 3 endpoints for using these resources. You can comment out the ones that you don't want to use and run the demo simply with `cargo shuttle run` 🚀.
