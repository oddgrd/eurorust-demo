# Shuttle Demo 🚀

This is a demo service for showcasing Shuttle.

The demo consists of 3 steps:

1. Creating a "hello world" endpoint.
2. Adding the shared database.
3. Serving static assets.

## Running the Demo 🏃

Run [`git-history`](https://github.com/pomber/git-history) for showing the code changes:

```sh
npx git-file-history src/main.rs
```

Respectfully, check out the selected commit from the command-line and run/deploy the service:

```sh
git checkout <commit>
cargo shuttle run
```
